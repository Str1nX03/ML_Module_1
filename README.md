# ML_Module_1
This is one of the parts of module I studied in order to grasp fundamental knowledge in the field of Machine Learning. In this module, I have included topics like Basic knowledge of required python libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn), Data Standardization, Label Encoding, etc with python code and short explanations. Hope it helps.
